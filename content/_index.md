# Build a serverless application

### Overall

In this workshop, I'll introduce Serverless framework and how to use it to build a serverless application and integrate with some aws services.

- **Initialize resource for the frontend**: You'll use the Serverless Framework to set up the resource needed to deploy a static web application hosted on S3.
- **Initialize resource for the backend and deploy Lambda functions**: Using the Serverless Framework, you'll deploy the backend Lambda functions and configure API Gateway, DynamoDB, and other AWS services.
- **Create a CI/CD pipeline**: Set up an automated CodePipeline to build and deploy the frontend application to AWS S3 whenever there are updates in the source code repository.
